No, this does not appear to be malignant melanoma.

Here's my reasoning:

*   **Color:** The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous mix of colors – brown, tan, and some lighter areas – which is common in benign nevi (moles). Melanomas typically have a more uniform color.
*   **Shape:** The lesion has irregular borders and a somewhat irregular shape. While irregularity can be seen in melanoma, it's not as sharply defined as it could be.
*   **Size:** The lesion appears to be relatively small, which is less concerning than larger lesions.
*   **Overall Appearance:** The lesion has a mottled appearance with many small, distinct color variations, which is more characteristic of a common mole rather than melanoma.
